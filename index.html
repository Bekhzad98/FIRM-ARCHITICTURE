                    <h4>Our mission and goals</h4>
                    <p>
                        We strive to create architecture that is simple, beautiful, and economical of both means and gestures. We believe that architecture should be integral with its place and that the best buildings allow people to fully experience the light and nature of that place.  Our chief pursuit is a timeless expression of architecture that is appropriate to its users and their purpose, that blends progressive technology with elemental form.

                    The first lesson I learned from Farshid Moussavi—formerly of FOA and founder of Farshid Moussavi Architecture—was "in architecture, one must be opportunistic." This has inspired me to seek out interesting collaborators and non-standard design projects.

            <p>Since 2015, I have been the architect for Art Toronto, an annual art fair that takes place over four days. We've built two iterations of the fair and I'm currently working on the third. I approach it as though I'm masterplanning a pop-up city, so it combines architecture, urbanism, and art.</p>
